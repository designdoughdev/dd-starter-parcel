# DD Starter Template 

1. Navigate to your Wordpress local development environment and into your 'themes' directory 

2. Install the starter theme within this folder. You can clone the repository by using:


```git clone https://github.com/designdoughdev/dd-starter-parcel.git```

2. Enter theme directory then initilise with this command in terminal

```npm init -y```

3. Then install dependencies with

```npm i```

4. This will install Parcel so you can run your own local development server. To start run:

This will watch for any changes in the styling/js  and will rebuild the assets when changes are made to them.
